# GKN_Machine_Tending_Project
The main objective of the project was to design robust object detection model which can detect filled or empty slots present in the workbench with machined parts.
The design should be able to find all available free slots for finished materials and communicate meaningful coordinates to a robot to place them at a specific location.
